# OpenWeather-SPA
This is Single Page Application, which can get the weather status based on location, city name, city pin code and latitude &amp; longitude.
Basically, it was created to learn myself the basics of javascript, html and pinch of css.
In the back of it, I'm using openWeather API to get the weather details.
